Steps to be followed while running the code:
This project is made with sqlite using manual functionaities and hence have to run all the SQL codes present in database.sql and then run the code, which would
help in running the file better and accurately

The frontend programming files like the index.html and home.html are present in the public folder and the rest are outside in the main folder, this file consist 
of node modules file which is just extra folder helping in running the node command and libraries

The index.html consist of the login page which shall be done where the password is "admin" and username is also "admin" once login is done it is transfered to the home.html page which has all the html, css and js code out there and rest backend programs are present in the server.js code which is present outside in the main folder.

I am considering the roll number as the main private key and the program revolves around itself only in the entire project as the roll number shall be unique as per the batch selected by them.

The Readme and Images folder also consist of images/screenshots of the view how the website is build and developed.

There are multiple langauges used for developing this project like:
html, css, js, angular, mysql, bootstrap and node which all in total helped in creating a better view of the project
